In the previous chapter, LDPC encoding and decoding approach illustrates the 
necessity of high throughput and low latency. Our objective is to design an architecture for the 
5G channel that promises higher throughputs with lower latency. The proposed architecture reflects
 the advantages offered by HLS.

A partial parallel and full pipelined is used for the proposed decoding technique. This design exploits
 the advantages of FPGA. Partial parallel means that this design starts updating multiple rows and columns
 at the same time. Full pipeline refers to the ability of HLS to update a row and a column in a single
 clock cycle.
