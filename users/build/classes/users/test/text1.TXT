To approximate this, there is a useful reason. It is good to have lesser computations and 
it is close enough to actual the exact completion. So the minsum approximation is the best
 thing to do here.We saw this before, the absolute value is dominated by the minimum of
 these values. So let us say if the computation of non-linear function has really no
 loss in practice, so usually we can do a little offset as well, we will implement it
 in the decoder.
