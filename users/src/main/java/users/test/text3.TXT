So it turns out minsum is pretty useful approximation, now need to improve approximation. Instead of
 just taking the minimum of two values, we take some constants a and b multiply with that and add b.
Typically scaling is not preferred. We just used minimum minus some offset. Subtracting with
 some offset makes it more accurate. Offset min sum approximation is the added modification to the above
 algorithm. Our implementation used a small offset minsum with layering on our proposed decoder.
